  '<h2>Culture &amp; Commerce: What Happened When I Hosted Club Seven Menswear</h2>

<p><strong>By Kiera H.</strong><br/>Phresh Phactory TV</p>

<hr/>

<p>There is a difference between going live and actually selling.</p>

<p>This week, I hosted a live session with Club Seven Menswear, and what stood out was not just the product. It was the founder''s journey and how directly it connects to what he created.</p>

<p>Alex Gede, a UK national of Nigerian descent, did not stumble into this business. His path was shaped over time through lived experience, discipline, and observation.</p>

<p>Before Club Seven Menswear, Alex faced personal challenges with eating disorders. That part of his story matters because it led to a complete shift in how he approached his body, his health, and his daily habits. Through fitness and consistency, he rebuilt that relationship and eventually became a fitness model working on brand campaigns.</p>

<p>That is where the problem revealed itself.</p>

<p>Despite being in peak physical condition and working with established brands, the underwear he was given for campaigns was often uncomfortable. It did not support the body properly. It did not account for movement, heat, or structure. It looked the part, but it did not perform.</p>

<p>While much of the world slowed down during recent global health challenges, Alex used that time differently. Instead of distractions, he focused. With a digital tablet and pen, he began designing what he felt was missing.</p>

<p>Not just another pair of underwear. A correction.</p>

<h3>Design That Actually Considers the Body</h3>

<p>Most brands rely on standard material formulas to reduce cost. A common blend is 95 percent cotton and 5 percent elastin. It is familiar, but it is not optimized.</p>

<p>Club Seven Menswear takes a different approach.</p>

<p>Alex selected materials like bamboo that are quick drying and naturally help manage sweat. This is not just a comfort decision. It is a performance decision.</p>

<p>The structure of each piece is designed to conform to the body while also creating space where it is needed most. That detail is often overlooked across the industry.</p>

<p>The result is a product that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supports without compressing unnecessarily</li>
<li>Allows airflow and reduces moisture buildup</li>
<li>Creates space for comfort regardless of body type</li>
</ul>

<p>There is also an unspoken layer here. Yes, the design can enhance appearance and confidence. But at its core, this is about comfort that should have existed all along.</p>

<h3>Solving a Problem That Has Been Ignored</h3>

<p>What stood out to me during the live is how many brands have simply accepted discomfort as normal.</p>

<p>Too tight. Too restrictive. Poor material choices. Short product lifespans.</p>

<p>Club Seven Menswear is addressing that gap directly.</p>

<p>Whether someone needs more room or simply wants a better fit, the design accounts for it. It is inclusive in a practical way, not a marketing statement.</p>

<p>And beyond the product itself, the brand is built with intention:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eco friendly materials</li>
<li>Conscious packaging decisions</li>
<li>Participation in tree planting initiatives</li>
<li>A focus on durability to reduce waste</li>
</ul>

<p>If a product lasts longer and performs better, it is less likely to end up in a landfill. That is a design choice, not an afterthought.</p>

<h3>Why This Matters in Culture &amp; Commerce</h3>

<p>This is exactly why I host these sessions.</p>

<p>Not just to showcase products, but to surface the thinking behind them. When a founder has lived the problem, the solution tends to be sharper.</p>

<p>During the live, Alex shared that the experience of being guided through the conversation was different from going live alone. That matters.</p>

<p>Because most founders are expected to sell, explain, demonstrate, and engage all at once. When that pressure is reduced, the product has more space to speak for itself.</p>

<p>And in this case, it did.</p>

<hr/>

<h3>Final Thought</h3>

<p>Comfort should not be a luxury in something worn every day.</p>

<p>Club Seven Menswear is a response to that reality. Built from experience, tested through real use, and designed with intention.</p>

<p>If you are evaluating products not just on how they look, but how they perform and how they are made, this is worth a closer look.</p>
