      question: "What's included in the Starter Audit?",
      answer: "The Starter Audit includes a comprehensive assessment of your current operations, identifying gaps and inefficiencies. You'll receive a detailed report with actionable recommendations and a 90-day roadmap for implementation. We also include two implementation sessions to help you get started."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I upgrade from one package to another?",
      answer: "Absolutely! Many clients start with a Starter Audit and then move to the Fractional Exec package for implementation support. We make the transition seamless and will apply any relevant credits from your current package."
    },
    {
      question: "Is there a minimum commitment period?",
      answer: "The Starter Audit is a one-time engagement. For Fractional Exec, we require a 3-month minimum commitment to ensure we have enough time to implement meaningful changes. The Board Advisor role requires a 6-month commitment."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I need additional services beyond my package?",

      question: "Do you offer refunds if I'm not satisfied?",
      answer: "We stand behind our work. If you're not satisfied with our services within the first 30 days, we'll work with you to address any concerns or offer a partial refund based on the work completed."
